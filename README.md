# MovieSuccessPrediction
The goal of the project was to accurately categorize a movie into three categories: “flop”, “hit”, or “blockbuster”. To implement this project we explored several methods that could help us predict the success of a movie with the highest accuracy. We split this project into two tasks. First, we analyzed an existing dataset for the movies to come up with any trends and patterns that could help us with the prediction. This included various techniques, such as preprocessing the data and feature reduction which improved our accuracy immensely. Feature reduction was key in overcoming the curse of dimensionality because there were over 25 features for each movie in our dataset. Once we were confident with the prediction algorithm that we implemented using a decision tree, we split up the dataset into train and test sets. After many attempts and low accuracy scores with various models, we were able to obtain an accuracy score of 84.6% and a precision score of 94% after the implementation of a decision tree model and with the use of Gini Index as the impurity measure. With this major improvement, we were able to accurately predict the category under which a movie will fall and thus achieved our goal. This prediction is of great significance to movie stakeholders and producers and with this, they will be able to take the necessary steps to make a movie more profitable or axe the movie if needed. Also, the movie industry can use our implementation to modify the movie criteria for obtaining likelihood of blockbusters. Movie audience can also use our model to know whether it is going to be worth their time and money to watch a certain movie.
